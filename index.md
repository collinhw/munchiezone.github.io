# About Munchie Zone

Munchie Zone is a meteor application which allows users to combine food orders in order to avoid expensive delivery charges. Users are also able to set dietary restrictions while searching through orders, and can also be pinged on their phone whenever a new order with their favorite food or restaurant is involved. Anyone with a University of Hawaii account is able to access this product after logging in.

This Milestone occurred on November 2, 2017. In it, we created mockups of various pages using Semantic UI, HTML, and CSS. Our mockup was developed using Meteor as well as templates and FlowRouter. The following are screenshots of our mockups:
